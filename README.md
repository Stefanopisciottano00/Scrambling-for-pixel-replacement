# Scrambling-for-pixel-replacement
this repository contains the material to perform pixel scrambling on the face region, allowing to increase the privacy of the filmed subjects.

The project is divided in this way:

- descrambled_videos: this folder will contain the videos after the descrambling process.
- scramble_videos:  this folder will contain the videos after the scrambling process.
- process: there's an illustration of the whole process.
- temp: in this folder will be saved all temporary images, produced during the execution of the scripts
- testSet: example video to start from
- Scrambling_mp4.py: this is the script to scramble video and add an hidden watermark for the operation of descrambling
- Descrambling_mp4.py: this is the script to descramble video starting from scramble video, extracting the watermark
